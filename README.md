# Rethinking Trees: RGGS-AMNH Workshop
**Marcelo Gehara & Jose Padial**

## History

### 18th - 19th centuries

+ Linnaeus: started comprehensive classification of species
+ Lamarck: classification reflects a natural order, not just arbitrary human decisions
  + Species have primitive and derived characteristics
+ Cuvier: proposed the idea of extinction
+ Darwin: drawings of trees, showing extinct species
+ Haeckel: artist who depicted trees, teleological idea of "progressing" towards humans

### The Modern Synthesis

+ Genetics being made more rigorous
+ Trees no longer as common - no one knew how to build a tree rigorously (mathematically)
  + Focusing on the future, rather than history
+ Variation is discrete because gaps exist and hierarchical because groups are nested
+ Horizontal vs. hierarchical classifications
  + Horizontal = analogy (phenetic)
  + Vertical = homology (phylogenetic, natural)
+ Species are discrete entities

### German Naturalists

+ Tradition of working on comparative anatomy
+ Henning developed method to make trees (1950) - empirical tree thinking begins
  + Possible to refute a tree using evidence
+ Need to move from organisms -> characters -> species -> relationships/phylogeny
  + Idea of semaphorant: voucher specimen at a specific life stage
+ Tokogenetic (population) level relationships can be observed
  + Species-level relationships (phylogeny) must be inferred
+ Henning auxiliary principle: states that are shared should be considered evidence of kinship
  + Assume homology first
+ Synapomorphy: trait shared in species that originated in most recent common ancestor
+ Symplesiomorphy: trait present in distant ancestor and retained in some decendant clades
+ Adding more and more characters to a tree helps identify homoplasy (false homology)
